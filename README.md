# PerpDet - A perpetual motion machine detector

PerpDet is a device that can determine whether a machine in front of the device is a perpetual motion machine. This is a gag invention, as by the second law of Thermodynamics, perpetual motion machines cannot exist.

# Why?

The US Patent office automatically rejects any application that mentions "free energy" or "perpetual motion". This project aims to find out if they will reject a "perpetual motion machine detector" as well. It costs a lot to file a patent, by the way.

As far as I can tell, no one has ever tried to create such a device, probably because it serves no real purpose. Nevertheless, sell the shovels. Here is a link to a perpetual motion machine that has made it past the scrutiny of the US Patent office in 2006: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20070246939?oq=perpetual+motion+machine. It was later abandoned.
